# SimpleNumberCounter

This is my first published Android app, kept super simple so that it could be finished quickly.

## One better than hello world feature

Single page app designed to always fill the screen.

XML defining `dimen` values are used to adjust the text to different size screens.
The Values folders used are `h320dp` and `h640dp`.
Using the `h###dp` format (minimum height) makes sense for apps that fill the screen, and the values take into account screen rotation.
